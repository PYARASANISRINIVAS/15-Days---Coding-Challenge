 Why collections?

    * Their are many draw backs for the storing the data in the arrays:-
    *  1.continious allocation of the data.
    * 2.fixed size of space that we have declared.
    * 
    * To over come tha above problem the java has introduced the concept called the Collections

 What is Collections?
    * 
    * Simply the collections is an framework which will help in Store,retrieve,manipulate and process the data effeciently.

how it is different?
    * Collections refer to a framework that provides a set of interfacesand  classes  for managing and manipulating 
    groups of objects created form the specific classes
    *Interfaces and classes will represent  different type of collections and their behaviour.

    Iterator interface:-
    Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.
    
    Interfaces: Interfaces define the common behavior and operations that different types of collections should support. 
    Some important interfaces include:
            1.List: Represents an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicates.
            2.Set: Represents a collection of unique elements, without any particular order.
            3.Queue: Represents a collection designed for holding elements before processing.
            4.Map: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
    Classes: The Java Collections Framework provides several classes that implement the collection interfaces.
    Some commonly used classes include:
            1.ArrayList: Implements the List interface using a resizable array.
            2.LinkedList: Implements the List interface using a doubly-linked list.
            3.HashSet: Implements the Set interface using a hash table.
            4.TreeSet: Implements the Set interface using a self-balancing binary search tree.
            5.HashMap: Implements the Map interface using a hash table.
            6.TreeMap: Implements the Map interface using a self-balancing binary search tree.
